Cylinder-based approximation of 3D objects
*******
The automotive industry faces increasingly strict regulations concerning fleet CO<sub>2</sub>  and pollutant emissions, which require innovative drive systems. To meet
these requirements, a fleet containing a mix of conventional, hybrid and purely electric vehicles seems to be one likely answer. To handle the space challenges that the adding of electrical components produce, transmission synthesis tools have been developed. The industry successfully applies them to synthesize transmissions for purely electric, conventional and hybrid powertrains. A full evaluation of the transmission concept, however, requires design drafts. Therefore,
automatizing the transmission design process is the content of current research, focusing on a fast generation of design drafts for multiple transmission topologies found by the transmission synthesis.


For the computer-aided optimization of engineering designs, 3D-objects may be
approximated for later computational efficiency reasons. For instance, it may be
beneficial to inner-approximate objects by coaxial cylinders. This task's goal is a
model that uses few cylinders while approximating the main features of the object
(e.g., edges/surfaces) well.
