+ PAPER: A circle packing algorithm
+ Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772102000998
+ This is a 2D version. It may be useful to analogously solve our problem in 3D (Cylinders)
+ Dirichlet-type problem: The authors discuss implementation, rates of convergence, stability and speed.
--> Triangulation of the topology. Vertices (interior and boundary) associated with circles. 
--> It addresses "overlap packing" which we can relate to the union of the cylinders.

*THESIS :Methods for Polygonalization of a Constructive Solid Geometry Description in Web-based Rendering Environments
* Important information:
1- The author look into taking STL CAD files and making web web browser edit and exchange of physical objects.
2- The author also examine reevaluate existing methods for CSG polygonalization and to adapt them to this new environment


* GITHUB : SCalaCAD 
* Important information:
1- Constructive Solid Geometry library/DSL for Scala with support for creating, visualizing, and exporting 3D models. Models created with ScalaCad can be exported to the STL file format for 3D printing.
2- can be used to look into how we can implement so things in Matlab.
