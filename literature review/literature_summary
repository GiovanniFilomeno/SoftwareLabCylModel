* If we model our problem mathematically as an optimization problem, the following books might be helpful
* (e.g. Maximise Area, constraints: walls and no gaps, variables: radii and positions and number)
*
* Book: Introduction to Applied Optimization
* Important information:
* Chapter 1: General overview
* Chapter 1.5: Classification of optimization problems
* Chapter 3.6: Algorithms for (constrained) nonlinear problems
* (Chapter 4.3: Methods for discrete optimization)
* Chapter 6.2: Methods for multiobjective optimization
* PDF: Attached in literature review
*
* Book: Solving Optimization Problems with MATLAB
* Similar structure to above book, gives implementation details in matlab
* PDF: Attached in literature review
*
* Book: Numerical Nonsmooth Optimization
* Depending on our modeling, objective function might be nonsmooth
* Then, classical optimization algorithms will fail
* Might contain helpful algorithms
