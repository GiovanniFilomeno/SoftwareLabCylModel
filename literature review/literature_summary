* If we model our problem mathematically as an optimization problem, the following books might be helpful
* (e.g. Maximise Area, constraints: walls and no gaps, variables: radii and positions and number)
*
* Book: Introduction to Applied Optimization
* Important information:
* Chapter 1: General overview
* Chapter 1.5: Classification of optimization problems
* Chapter 3.6: Algorithms for (constrained) nonlinear problems
* (Chapter 4.3: Methods for discrete optimization)
* Chapter 6.2: Methods for multiobjective optimization
* PDF: Attached in literature review
*
* Book: Solving Optimization Problems with MATLAB
* Similar structure to above book, gives implementation details in matlab
* PDF: Attached in literature review
*
* Book: Numerical Nonsmooth Optimization
* Depending on our modeling, objective function might be nonsmooth
* Then, classical optimization algorithms will fail
* Might contain helpful algorithms
* PDF: Attached in literature review

*Thesis :Methods for Polygonalization of a Constructive Solid Geometry Description in Web-based Rendering Environments
* Important information:
1- The author look into taking STL CAD files and making web web browser edit and exchange of physical objects.
2- The author also examine reevaluate existing methods for CSG polygonalization and to adapt them to this new environment



* Github : SCalaCAD 
* Important information:
1- Constructive Solid Geometry library/DSL for Scala with support for creating, visualizing, and exporting 3D models. Models created with ScalaCad can be exported to the STL file format for 3D printing.

2- can be used to look into how we can implement so things in Matlab.
