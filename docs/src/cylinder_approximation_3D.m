    % Parameters which influence the approximation:
    % Parameters for create_sections_initial:
    number_of_sections = 10; % defines maximum thickness of every section
    % by setting thickness > (max(y)-min(y))/number_of_sections
    area_percentage_parallel = 0.05; % If a part of the goemetry with an
    % area of more than this value is parallel to the y-plane, then the
    % corresponding y-value will be included as a position for a cut.
    ends_offset_fraction = 0.2; % If there is no 2D-polygon at the ends of
    % the geometry, which is parallel to the y-plane, than the geometry is
    % cut at a certain offset. This offset is the maximum thickness delta
    % times this fraction.
    
    % Parameters for rewriteY_values:
    maximal_area_difference_ratio = 0.97; % If the ratio of intersection/union
    % of 2 polygons is smaller or equal to that value, than they are
    % regarded as very different and the corresponding cut remains.
    
    % Parameters for create_cylinders/create_circles:
    number_circles_per_section = 40; % maximum number of circles, that are
    % defined at every 2D-polygon
    red_radius_factor = 20; % Relative radius of red cylinders, which are
    % subtracted from the geometry. The higher, the more accurate in
    % theory, but there may be some numerical difficulties
    
    % Further parameters, that can be set in the functions:
    % -Some tolerances in create_sections_initial and define_2D_polygons
    % -accuracy_factor in remove_circles_proximity
    % -area criteria in remove_circles
